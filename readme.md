Serverless Basic Authentication (http basic auth)
--------------------------------------------

Sometimes you need to integrate your api with some outside system, and you are not capable of setting up custom headers with keys. Almost all systems support Basic Authentication out of the box though. Which is where this plugin comes in.

This plugin will install a custom authenticator for the functions you specify as being private, and use the API Keys (so no user management required) as http basic username and password.

When using this plugin, you can use both the `x-api-key` header, or the `Authorization` header for authentication.

Installation
------------
`npm install serverless-basic-authentication`

Add the plugin to your settings:

```
plugins:
  - serverless-basic-authentication
```

And give access so that the plugin can check the api keys:
```
provider:
  name: aws
  ...
  iamRoleStatements:
    ...
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        - apigateway:GET
      Resource: "*"
```

Usage
-----

Add some keys to your service:

```
provider:
  name: aws
  ...
  apiKeys:
    - foobar
    - platypus
```

For each function that responds to `http` events and is marked as `private: true`, the custom authenticator will be inserted, like so:

```
functions:
  foobar:
    handler: handler.foobar
    events:
      - http:
          path: foo/bar
          method: get
          private: true
```

For more fine-grained control over which functions are enabled for basic auth, use the `basicAuth` attribute on events. If any of the functions' events is marked with the flag `basicAuth`, then only the events with `basicAuth=true` are configured with basic auth.

```
functions:
  foo:
    handler: handler.foo
    events:
      - http:
          path: foo
          method: get
          basicAuth: true     # Basic auth enabled
  bar:
    handler: handler.bar
    events:
      - http:
          path: bar
          method: get
          private: true       # Basic auth not enabled (may use some other default authorizer)
```

To send the correct header so that browsers will prompt for username and password, add a `GatewayResponse` to the `resources`:

```
resources:
  Resources:
    GatewayResponse:
      Type: 'AWS::ApiGateway::GatewayResponse'
      Properties:
        ResponseParameters:
          gatewayresponse.header.WWW-Authenticate: "'Basic'"
        ResponseType: UNAUTHORIZED
        RestApiId:
          Ref: 'ApiGatewayRestApi'
        StatusCode: '401'
```

If you are whitelisting files to be packaged, ensure you add `basic_auth.py` to the list otherwise the authorizer will fail:

```
package:
  exclude:
    - "./**/**"
  include:
    - basic_auth.py
```

**Note:** The plugin checks if a custom authorizer is already set. So if you provide a custom authorizer it will not override your custom authorizer.

After deploying, you can call the endpoint with a basic auth username/password:

```
curl -u [key-name]:[key-value] https://abckudzdef.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/foo/bar
"yay"
```

How does this work?
-------------------
In Api Gateway, the custom authorizer function can also be used to supply the api key for a request. In this case, we lookup the api key on the fly through the api-gateway api, and check if the key matches. If so, we tell Api Gateway to use that key for handling the calls.
